        I just wanted to make it very clear that I (the developer)
        I am not responsible for the challenges or accidents caused by the application, do and play in moderation.\n\n
        Minors * NO * select high age lists. Children should always play with
        a responsible person next to him.\n\n
        The app is still in its beta phase, any type of error or bug, please report on Google Play. (You will receive a little star ⭐).\n\n
        Enough talk… Good game and see you next time! (Enjoy and leave your comment on Google Play, help me too much)

        The system will choose a random player or
        sequential (Depends on how you set it up) to ask the questions. The player will have
        two choices between speaking a truth, or running a challenge. Then there will be two buttons that are
        to define whether the player actually did an action or not. If you mark the player who did not make,
        the system will remove points from the player, if it reaches * ZERO *, the player will be eliminated and removed
        of the game.\n\n

        I will explain how this mode works, so pay close attention. 0_0 \n\n
        Basically this is a mode where functions and resources are limited as:\n
        * 2 points will be set for all players.\n
        * At random times you may fall into a challenge.\n
        * There is a limit of 3 truths / challenges that you can select in sequence.\n\n
        Well… These are the main changes in this mode, there was no change in the lists. Good luck!

        To add a player is very simple. Just write the person\'s name/nickname

        Genres are used to define types of questions or challenges for 2 players
        whose sexuality is opposite. You can edit Tapping on the player\'s name and identified
